<h3>About This Course</h3><hr>
<p>
This class primarily serves as an introduction to Python and, more broadly, to programming. Our goal is to work towards certification in Information Technology Specialist – Python (ITS-303).
</p>

<p>
Since we meet only once a week, I highly encourage you to dedicate as much time as possible to practicing Python and gaining hands-on experience.
I also strongly recommend starting small personal projects as soon as possible. Don't worry about whether they seem achievable at first—what matters most is that they are meaningful or interesting to you.

<h3>About This Site </h3>  <hr>
<p>
This site primarily serves as a static repository for distributing slides and resources. The main advantage of this approach is that it allows me to update notes and slides seamlessly, eliminating the need to email materials to all members individually.

Please feel free to suggest any materials you would like to see included on this site. Your input is always welcome!
</p>



<h3>ITS Specialist</h3> <hr>
<p>
The ITS Specialist exam primarily consists of multiple-choice questions and similar variations. These variations often include:
<ul>
<li>Drag-and-drop components, where you align descriptions with the correct terms.</li>
<li>Code completion tasks, requiring you to arrange the correct syntax within a program.</li>
<li>Drop-down selections, where you choose the appropriate value to complete a statement.</li>
<li>Additionally, you may be required to read a block of code and predict its output to demonstrate your understanding.</li>
</ul> 

The exam will be administered through Certiport. Therefore, you will need to create an account with Certiport, which can be done using the link provided below.

You can also review the outlined learning objectives.

<h3> Class Conten</h3>
<p>
The link below contains the slides from our first class. In this session, we provided a broad but introductory overview of the topics we will cover throughout the course. Most, if not all, of these topics will be revisited in greater depth as we progress.

I will likely rewrite the slides in the future to improve clarity and detail.

In this session, we primarily explored how Python differs from other programming languages, highlighting its advantages and potential drawbacks. We also discussed the history of Python and some of its key functionalities.

<h2>002 - Data Types</h2>
<div class="segment">

<h3><u> Data Types</u></h3>

In this set of slides primarily covers data types in Python, with a particular focus on the concept of mutability.
While this may seem theoretical at first, understanding mutability provides valuable context for how different data types behave and how their methods function.
To explore these concepts, we used functions such as is and id to demonstrate specific behaviors. We also discussed different ways to declare integer values using various base systems, such as binary and hexadecimal.
Additionally, we introduced:
	
<ul>
	<li>Numerics & collections</li>
	<li>Slicing and indexing</li>
	<li>Type conversion between different data types</li>
	<li>None Object Data Type</li>
	<li>Comparison Operators</li>
	<li>Comparing and contrasting strings</li>
	<li>in keyword (Built-in function)</li>
	<li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
	<li>Character code values and order of operations</li>
</ul>


The provided exercise focuses on code tracing and practising Python code execution.
I'd like you to carefully read the given code segment and then figure out its output. 
It may be helpful to take notes explaining why you expect a particular outcome.

Once you have made your prediction, I recommend typing the code into an IDE of your choice and running it. Be sure to investigate any unexpected behavior and experiment with modifications to confirm your understanding of the logic.
