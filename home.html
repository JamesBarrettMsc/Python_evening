<h2> 000 - Overview & Wellcome</h2>
	<div class="segment">
	
	<h3>About This Course</h3><hr>
	<p>
		This class primarily serves as an introduction to Python and, more broadly, to programming. Our goal is to work towards certification in Information Technology Specialist – Python <b>(ITS-303)</b>.
		Since we meet only once a week, I highly encourage you to dedicate as much time as possible to practising Python and gaining hands-on experience.
		I also strongly recommend starting small personal projects as soon as possible. Don't worry about whether they seem achievable at first—what matters most is that they
		are meaningful or interesting to you.

	</p>
	
	<p>
		The ITS Specialist exam primarily consists of multiple-choice questions and similar variations. These variations often include:
		<ul>
			<li>Drag-and-drop components, where you align descriptions with the correct terms.</li>
			<li>Code completion tasks, requiring you to arrange the correct syntax within a program.</li>
			<li>Drop-down selections, where you choose the appropriate value to complete a statement.</li>
			<li>Additionally, you may be required to read a block of code and predict its output to demonstrate your understanding.</li>
		</ul> 
		The exam will be administered through Certiport. Therefore, you will need to create an account with Certiport, which can be done using the link provided below.
		You can also review the outlined learning objectives.

<h2> 001 - Introduction to Programming</h2>
<div class="segment">
	<p>
	The link below contains the slides from our first class. In this session, we provided a broad but introductory overview of the topics we will cover throughout the course. Most, if not all, of these topics will be revisited in greater depth as we progress.
	I will likely rewrite the slides in the future to improve clarity and detail.
	In this session, we primarily explored how Python differs from other programming languages, highlighting its advantages and potential drawbacks. We also discussed the history of Python and some of its key functionalities.
	
	<br> <br> 
	<i> Topics covered are the following:</i>
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Versions Python</li>
		<li>IDE’s</li>
		<li>Where is Python used?</li>
		<li>REPL - Read, Eval, Print Loop.</li>
		<li>Variables</li>
		<li>Constants</li>
		<li>Identifiers</li>
	</ul>

<h2>002 - Data Types</h2>
<div class="segment">
	<p>
		In this set of slides primarily covers data types in Python, with a particular focus on the concept of mutability.
		While this may seem theoretical at first, understanding mutability provides valuable context for how different data types behave and how their methods function.
		To explore these concepts, we used functions such as is and id to demonstrate specific behaviors. We also discussed different ways to declare integer
		values using various base systems, such as binary and hexadecimal.
		Additionally.

		<br> <br> 
		<i> Topics covered are the following:</i>
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Numerics & collections</li>
		<li>Slicing and indexing</li>
		<li>Type conversion between different data types</li>
		<li>None Object Data Type</li>
		<li>Comparison Operators</li>
		<li>Comparing and contrasting strings</li>
		<li>in keyword (Built-in function)</li>
		<li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
		<li>Character code values and order of operations</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		The provided exercise focuses on code tracing and practising Python code execution.
		I'd like you to carefully read the given code segment and then figure out its output. 
		It may be helpful to take notes explaining why you expect a particular outcome.
		Once you have made your prediction, I recommend typing the code into an IDE of your choice and running it. Be sure to investigate any unexpected
		behavior and experiment with modifications to confirm your understanding of the logic.

<h2>003 - Input Output & Formatting</h2>
<div class="segment">

	<p>
		This section covers various methods for handling input and output in Python. User input is obtained using the input function, while the split() method is used to process string data. 
		The eval function allows for dynamic evaluation of expressions, and command-line arguments provide additional flexibility in script execution. The len function is used to determine 
		the length of sequences, while the print function facilitates output display. String formatting 
		is demonstrated using both the format() method and f-strings, offering efficient ways to structure output.
		<br> <br> 
		<i> Topics covered are the following:</i>
	</p>
		
	<ul>
		<li>Getting input From the Keyboard with input</li>
		<li>Split() Method within the string object </li>
		<li>The eval Built-in function </li>
		<li>Command Line arguments</li>
		<li>The len Built-in function</li>
		<li>The print Built-in function </li>
		<li>The print Built-in function </li>
		<li>formatting strings with Method within the string object</li>
		<li>formatting strings with F"string" </li>

<h2>004 - Operators </h2>
<div class="segment">
	<p>
		This section explores operators in Python, which are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. Arithmetic operators handle mathematical calculations, including floor division, 
		which returns the largest whole number quotient. Comparison or relational operators are used to evaluate relationships between values, including string comparisons. Logical operator
		s help in making decisions by combining Boolean expressions, while their behavior with non-Boolean types is also examined. Additionally, 
		bitwise operators manipulate individual bits within integers, enabling low-level data processing.
		<br> <br> 
		<i> Topics covered are the following:</i>
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>What is an Operator?</li>
		<li>Arithmetic operators</li>
		<li>Floor Division</li>
		<li>Comparison/Relational operators</li>
		<li>Comparing strings</li>
		<li>Logical operators</li>
		<li>Logical operators for Non-Boolean types</li>
		<li>Bitwise operators</li>

<h2>005 - Collection Datatypes </h2>
<div class="segment">
	<p>
		This section covers string manipulation, including slicing and indexing. It also explains how characters are represented in Python using code point values and code pages. 
		The use of the chr and ord functions was demonstrated to illustrate these concepts. Additionally, string comparisons were examined to provide a clearer understanding of how they are performed in Python.
		<br> <br>

<h2>006 - ITS Mock Test </h2>
<div class="segment">

	<p>
		In week six, an early review of a mock test was conducted, consisting of multiple-choice questions covering topics studied up to that point. The primary objective of this exercise was to familiarize
		participants with the structure of the ITS 303 exam and to highlight common pitfalls that could appear in the questions. 
		By engaging in this preliminary assessment, a deeper understanding of key concepts was reinforced, test-taking strategies were improved,
		and areas requiring further review were identified.
		
		<br> <br> 
		<i>Questions related to the following topics:</i>
	
	</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Indexing and slicing </li>
			<li> Assignment operation </li>

<h2>007- Flow Control  (I) </h2>
<div class="segment">

	<p>
		This section covers fundamental control flow structures in Python. Sequential execution follows a step-by-step approach, while selection structures, such as if-else,
		if-elif-else, and nested if statements, enable decision-making based on conditions. Repetition is handled using loops, including the while loop, which continues execution
		as long as a condition is met. Additionally, the use of else with loops is explored, demonstrating how it executes when a loop completes without interruption.
		<br> <br> 
		<i>Questions related to the following topics:</i>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Sequential</li>
		<li> Selection</li>
		<li> Repetition</li>
		<li> if-elif-else  </li>
		<li> nested if  </li>
		<li>While loop  </li>

	<p>
		
		The following exercise is a substantial project and should provide participants with an opportunity to explore and apply various techniques while developing software.
		<br>
		Your colleague stopped using LastPass due to security concerns and now stores passwords in a CSV file on a BitLocker-protected flash drive. 
		They acknowledge this method is flawed and misses features like searching, adding, removing, and updating credentials easily.
		They also wish for password generation, strength evaluation, and automatic updates but prioritize functionality over aesthetics.
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Note:</b> Some aspects of this project have not yet been fully addressed during class time.
